# Alone in the universe
For any of us, the question: "are we alone in the universe?‚Äù probably comes up at some point in our lives. This course is designed to provide some insights into this question. We start with defining who we are,  and what the nature of life might be. Then we will discuss the common home 
we all live in: the Earth, the solar system and the Universe. Finally we will describe several attempts to search for other life, other planets. This course only requires high-school knowledge, and a desire to know more about who we are.
